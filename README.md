During my internship at 'Academor', I gained valuable experience in mastering the Python programming language and key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and seaborn. 

I had the opportunity to work on two significant projects: a minor project where I developed a 'student planner system' independently, and a major project on Big Mart sales prediction. 
For the Big Mart project, my team and I developed a machine learning-based system that utilized historical sales data and product characteristics to optimize inventory management and profitability.
